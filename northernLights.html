            <i>THE OTHERWORLDLY AURORA borealis,</i> or northern lights, begain in the Earth's 
            atmosphere--at altitudes from 60 to more than 250 miles--when charged particles from 
            the sun become trapped in the Earth's magnetic field. The result is a colorful, dancing
            light show.

        <p>
            The first time I filmed an aurora was from an icebreaker near Antartica. Lubkily, 
            there are much more accessible places if you'd like to take in these light shows yourself. 
            For the best seats to this celestial scene, consider anywhere with a magnetic latitude above
            55 and low light pollution. Find your magnetic latitude on NOAA and here. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In the polar latitudes, auroras can appear on any dark night. Long winter nights are good 
            but not necessarily the best time. Near equinoxes in March and September, the Earth's magnetic
            field lets more solar particles interact with the atmosphere, creating aurora seasons! I suggest
            autumnal equinox in September, where there are pleasent temperatures in polar latitudes. Find the 
            dark hours of your location here, or by using a sky guide app.
