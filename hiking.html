            Solheimajokull glacier is an outlet from the mighty Myrdalsjokull and is surrounded
            by some of Iceland's most grand volcanoes and during summertime, a glacier lagoon 
            forms in front of the glacer only adding to the charm of the location. This popular
            day tour is the perfect way to get in real contact with the true reason behind the name
            Ice-land!
