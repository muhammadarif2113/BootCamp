    <h1>Iceland</h1>

    <p id="par"><b><i>Iceland</i></b> is a country of sharp contrasts. 
        A place where fire and ice co-exist. Where dark winters 
        are offset by the summer's midnight sun. A country where 
        insular existence has spurred a rich and vibrant culture.

                The Aurora Borealis takes its name from the Roman goddess of dawn, Aurora,
                and the Greek name for the north wind, Boreas. From september to april, 
                Iceland is a hotspot for this magnificent lightshow. <br>
                The Aurora Borealis, more commonly referred to as the Northern Lights is a 
                natural phenomenon created when particles emitted by the sun interact with the
                atmosphere in the Earth's magnetic field. This releases energy, causing peculiar
                luminous green streaks across the skies.

                When making a trip to Iceland, it is hard not to pay special attention to the country's 
                namesake--namely, its 4500 square miles of glacier. Ice climbing on the glaciers is practiced 
                year-round and takes place maily on the Solheimajokull and Svinafellsjokull glaciers in 
                the south of Iceland, to which day trips are offered from Reykjavik (and Skaftafull).
